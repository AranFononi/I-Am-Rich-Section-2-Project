# I Am Rich

### Project for Section 2: **Introduction to iOS Development**  
This project was completed as part of Section 2 in the **Complete iOS Development Bootcamp** by Angela Yu.

## Project Overview
**I Am Rich** is a minimalistic app that displays a wealth-inspired message, marking an early step in understanding iOS development. This project provided a solid foundation in the iOS development setup, building a simple interface, and familiarizing with Xcode tools.

- **ViewController Basics**: Understood the structure of a `UIViewController` and its role in the app.
- **UI Placement & Design**: Positioned UI elements like labels and images to design a static display.
- **Running Simulations**: Tested the app in the iOS Simulator to verify the layout and design.
